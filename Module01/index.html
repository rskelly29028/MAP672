<h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>

    <p>As one who refuses to purchase an iPhone, much of the concepts of The Floating Sheep Manifesto do not resonate with my lifestyle.  That said, I do appreciate the recognition of how the advent of the digital world and its incipient devices do create amongst ourselves a sense that we are at the center, much in the same way ancient Chinese maps always placed the Middle Kingdom at the center of the world.</p>
    <p>I see myself very much straddling the cusp between cartographer and critic.  I recognize the power of coding to swiftly make chanes which used to take days to execute, but ultimately cartography remains both an art and science which cannot be subjugated to binary data strings </p>
    <p>I am quite far along in my career in academia and have elected to enroll in this program precisely to become more familiar with the part of the triad - coding - with which I am least familiar</p>
    <p>The second point of the manifesto -- all maps lie, but the lies are the source of the power behind the map -- is the most provocative, precisely because maps, much like history, are written by those in power, be it the use of Mercator projections in the Cold War to instill fear in the USSR among American students, or to display that central Jerusalem is not a friendly place to the palette of the Arabic speaker when in reality it is a culinary paradise for speakers of all languages </p>
